# Weather Web Application README

## Overview

This Weather Web Application is a front-end project built using React. It allows users to search for current weather information for a specific location using a Weather API. This project showcases the usage of React hooks, specifically `useState`, to manage the application's state.

## Features

- **Search by Location:** Users can enter a location (city or zip code) to retrieve the current weather information for that location.

- **Display Weather Data:** The application displays the current temperature, weather condition, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon representing the conditions.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Weather Web Application locally on your machine:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd weather-app
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Weather API key. You can obtain a free API key by signing up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). Add the following line to your `.env` file:

   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to use the Weather Web Application.

## Usage

1. Enter a location (e.g., city name) in the search input field.

2. Click the "Search" button or press "Enter" to retrieve the current weather information for the specified location.

3. The weather data will be displayed below the search bar, including the temperature, weather condition, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon.

4. You can search for different locations by entering new queries in the search bar.

## Dependencies

This project utilizes the following dependencies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/): The Weather API used to retrieve weather data.
